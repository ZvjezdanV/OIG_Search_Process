# OIG_Search_Process
This project is coded using Python and Selenium WebDriver to help automate the Exclusions OIG Search Process

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
This project was coded using the Python Programming Language and the Selenium Chrome WebDriver in order to achieve the task of automating the Exclusions OIG Search Process. I saw this task as being manual & repetitive; so, I took the liberty of attempting to automate this process so I could spend my time completing other tasks that were assigned to me.

<br>This project goes through the steps of:
- Open Google Chrome
- Navigate to the Exclusions OIG Website
- Searches for our person of interest
- Checks if the person has any exciusion records against them. If they do, Python uses Selenium to scrape the data that displays on the page. 
- Creates a folder in a specified directory on the user's computer ( exact directory can be found in main_program.py )
- Creates the person's text file in the specified directory 
- Writes the person of interest's information inside of the text file using JSON format

<br>This project was coded using the following tools
- Python 3.8.6
- Selenium Chrome WebDriver ( 85 )
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows CMD Prompt
